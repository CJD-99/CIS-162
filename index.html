    <h2>Hello</h2>
    <p>I'm Collie Dorotheo, a Cerritos College student. I was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States in 2006. My college goal is to complete my associate's degree in CIS programming. I don't have experience with HTML and CSS, so this is my first time. My goals for this course are to learn about HTML and CSS so that I can make use of them when creating a website.</p>
