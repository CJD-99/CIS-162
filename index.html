 <h2>About Me</h2>   
<p>I'm Collie Dorotheo, a Cerritos College student. I was born in the Philippines and moved to the United States in 2006. My college goal is to complete my associate's degree in CIS programming. I don't have experience with HTML and CSS so this is my first time. My goals for this course is to learn about HTML and CSS so that I can make use of them when creating a website.</p>

<h2>When I have free time</h2>

<ol>
  <li>I walk my dogs</li>
  <li>Play video games</li>
  <li>Watch movies or TV series</li>
</ol>

<p>My favorite website is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> because there are a lot of entertaining and educational videos out there.
